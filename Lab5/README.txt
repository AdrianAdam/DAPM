Normal problems with Kotlin, nothing too serious.

I have worked before with CustomAdapters, but it was nice to redo everything in Kotlin.

The main differences between this project and the one in the link are:
-> The project in the link has 3 images per row, while ours has 1 image and text per row
-> Our project offers the option to add new cars, while the project in the link is static. Data can't be changed without access to source code.
