I ended up combining the two exercices into 1. When I press Listen, the fragment for listening is placed on the screen and text to speech is performed. When I press Open mic, the fragment for speaking is placed on the screen and speech is text is performed.

I had only one problem: Google was deactivated on my phone and I was receiving the error "no activity found to handle intent (RECOGNIZE_SPEECH)". After some quick searches on stack overflow I was able to fix the issue. 

There was also a weird error while recording the video. Speech to text doesn't work if I am recording the screen. The error returned is Network Error. If I stop recording, it works perfectly.

Check the videos.
